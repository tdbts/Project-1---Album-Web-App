This will be my first programming miniproject.  I will piece together all the various aspects of coding I have learned thus far to create a simple web app.  

My project will center around albums that I do not currently own, but which mean a lot to me.

The "meat" of the app will contain a picture of each album, along with some basic information (artist, title, genre, memories -- some sample lyrics as well would be dope).  The displayed information will change according to which particular album the user selects.  

I would like to include the following elements:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery (linked from CDN)
- JSON data or XML data
- AJAX
- Membership
- Search capability
- Use of Version Control System (Git) throughout
- Post to GitHub

By pulling together these elements, I hope to increase my understanding of the concepts I have encountered thus far.
